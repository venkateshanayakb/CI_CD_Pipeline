1) Built a healthcare reimbursement prediction system using CMS inpatient data.
Reduced prediction error from 54 percent to 17 percent through feature engineering and structured preprocessing pipeline. Deployed via CI CD on cloud.

2) Linear Regression Performance:
MAE  : 1416.90
RMSE : 2658.69
R2   : 0.8663

Medicare reimbursement in this dataset is:

• Largely linear in encoded feature space
• Strongly structured
• Not driven by chaotic nonlinear interactions

Which makes sense.

Medicare payment rules are formula-based, DRG-weighted, policy-defined. They are not like stock markets.

A linear model fits policy systems beautifully.

You just empirically confirmed that.

That’s far more impressive than squeezing 0.01 improvement from Random Forest.

Why Random Forest Lost

Tree ensembles shine when:

• Complex nonlinear interactions exist
• Feature relationships are highly irregular
• Decision boundaries are messy

But here:

• DRG one-hot encoding already separates procedure types cleanly
• State encoding captures geographic adjustment
• Discharges scale nearly proportionally

The system behaves almost piecewise linear.

Linear regression wins because the world here is rule-based.

Compared linear and ensemble models on CMS inpatient reimbursement data. 
Found that linear regression outperformed Random Forest, indicating structured reimbursement patterns consistent with policy-driven pricing.”

3) Here is a clear, structured summary of everything you have done so far. This reads like a project report, not a casual recap.

Project Summary: Healthcare Reimbursement Prediction System with CI/CD
1. Infrastructure and Deployment

• Designed a backend API using FastAPI to serve machine learning predictions
• Built a frontend interface using Streamlit for user interaction
• Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
• Configured automated deployment to Render cloud
• Added health check endpoints for service monitoring
• Structured project as a production-style monorepo
• Managed environment variables securely for deployment

This established full-stack ML system deployment capability.

2. Dataset Upgrade

• Replaced toy house price dataset with real CMS inpatient hospital charges dataset
• Cleaned monetary columns by removing dollar signs and commas
• Standardized column names
• Selected relevant healthcare features:

Total Discharges

Provider State

DRG Definition
• Defined target variable:

Average Medicare Payments

This transformed the project into a real healthcare economics modeling task.

3. Feature Engineering and Pipeline Design

• Implemented a ColumnTransformer for structured preprocessing
• Applied:

StandardScaler for numeric features

OneHotEncoder for categorical features
• Encapsulated preprocessing and model into a single scikit-learn Pipeline
• Ensured preprocessing consistency between training and inference

This made the system production-ready and reproducible.

4. Model Comparison

Trained and evaluated:

• Linear Regression
• Random Forest Regressor

Evaluated using:

• MAE
• RMSE
• R²
• MAPE

Findings:

• Linear Regression outperformed Random Forest
• R² ≈ 0.87 on raw scale
• Demonstrated that Medicare reimbursement structure is largely linear in encoded feature space

This provided structural insight into policy-driven pricing systems.

5. Error Analysis

Conducted detailed residual analysis:

• Computed residuals and absolute errors
• Identified heteroscedasticity (error increases with payment size)
• Analyzed worst prediction cases
• Found largest errors in high-severity DRGs (e.g., sepsis, ventilator cases)
• Identified state-level variation in prediction error
• Quantified error by payment buckets

Conclusion:

• Model performs well for routine procedures
• High-cost DRGs show larger variance
• Variance scales with payment magnitude

This elevated the project into analytical investigation.

6. Statistical Improvement via Log Transformation

Identified multiplicative error structure.

Applied:

• Log transformation to target variable
• Re-trained models on log scale
• Exponentiated predictions before metric calculation

Results:

• R² improved from 0.866 → 0.8807
• MAPE reduced from ~16.5% → ~14.0%
• Funnel-shaped heteroscedasticity significantly reduced
• Error became more stable across payment strata

This demonstrated econometric reasoning and model calibration improvement.

7. Model Selection Discipline

• Objectively compared models based on MAE
• Selected Linear Regression due to better performance and simplicity
• Saved best-performing model automatically
• Saved evaluation metrics in JSON for traceability

This showed engineering maturity and model governance thinking.

Technical Skills Demonstrated

• End-to-end ML system deployment
• Healthcare data preprocessing
• Feature encoding for high-cardinality categorical variables
• Model comparison methodology
• Residual and heteroscedasticity analysis
• Log-transformation for variance stabilization
• CI/CD automation
• Cloud deployment architecture
• API design and monitoring

Conceptual Insights Gained

• Medicare reimbursement follows structured, policy-driven patterns
• Reimbursement variability is multiplicative, not additive
• High-cost DRGs introduce variance scaling
• Simpler models can outperform complex ensembles when structure is linear

Current Model Performance (Log-Transformed)

Linear Regression:

• R² ≈ 0.881
• MAE ≈ 1275
• MAPE ≈ 14%

This is strong performance for real-world healthcare cost data.
